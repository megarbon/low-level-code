# C/Rust Fun Zone

Hey there! Welcome to this little corner of the coding universe where we're all about having a blast with C and Rust!

## What's the Deal?

So, you stumbled upon this repo, huh? Well, buckle up because you're in for some wild experimentation! We're talking about trying stuff out in C and Rust just for the heck of it. Whether you're a coding newbie or a seasoned pro, everyone's invited to join the party.

## What's Inside?

Honestly, it's a mishmash of whatever we feel like throwing in here. You might find:

- Wonky C programs that make you scratch your head.
- Rust code that's so elegant it'll make you weep (in a good way).
- Random experiments that may or may not make any sense.

## How to Play?
